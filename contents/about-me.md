template: about-me.jade

Hi!, I'm a software developer working for [Q42](http://www.q42.nl) doing all sorts on the back and frontend.


I'm also the author of the [ElasticSearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org) .NET client [Nest](http://www.github.com/Mpdreamz/NEST). 

Be sure to check out [my other projects too](http://www.github.com/Mpdreamz).

I have a passion for all things continuous be it testing, integration or deploying.

I loathe cms's and frameworks in general that concern themselves with too much but I'll contain my resentment and save it for a blog post or two :)
