      <section class="content"><p>A long time ago, when the world was young
Someone put some food on their tong
They tasted the food, and thought it was nice
Most fruit liked it - but banana&apos;s thought twice.

</p>
<p><span class="more"></span>

</p>
<p>They held a meeting at quarter past eight
Whilst the human&apos;s were getting home late
They decided they didn&apos;t want to be eaten
they said &quot;No way, we&apos;re not going to be beaten&quot;

</p>
<p>So time went by, and human&apos;s got old
Banana&apos;s got ready, for their prophets had told
That soon shall come the dawn of war.
Where humans will rule the earth no more.

</p>
<p>The humans knew not of the evil banana&apos;s plans
They made their cars, guitars and aluminum cans
And the banana&apos;s began to take over the east
While humans knew not, and kept having their feast.

</p>
<p>But time has run out, no more hiding there can be
Or else the banana&apos;s will kill George, you and me
We must take up arms, and fight to the end
Because, believe it or not, a banana is not a friend.
