      <section class="content"><p>So I started to blog, lets see how long I keep this up.

</p>
<p>Like most developers getting my blog up and running started to become the end goal instead of an ends to a means to get my so called words of wisdom on the internet.
So I&apos;m putting this up, wards and all, frankly who gives a damn (yet).

</p>
<p>Last time I tried to set up a blog I checked out Octopress and fell into the same trap: playing with code is alot easier then to actually blog. &quot;Oh hey this is made with ruby, let&apos;s redo <a href="http://rubykoans.com/">ruby-koans</a> and get reacquainted with the language&quot;. So this time I started looking for node based static site generators. as I know that ecosystem a whole lot better. Only to get sidetracked with the intricacies of the static site generator I ended up choosing: <a href="http://jnordberg.github.com/wintersmith/">wintersmith</a>. 

</p>
<p>The next thing to lure me away from actually writing a damn blog post was where to host it. 

</p>
<p>My first thought was github pages but that would mean generating the site and copying it to <code>gh-pages</code> branch commit/push and switch back. 
This didn&apos;t sound like an ideal work flow.

</p>
<p>My second thought was hosting it on Azure, I&apos;ve recently used it to deploy <a href="http://www.studioquestionmark.nl">a site for a friend</a> and was suprised with how painless that was to setup. I&apos;d just run the blog programmatically, tad wasteful but again who gives a damn wheter this blog is static or served from <code>server.js</code>.

</p>
<p>I then found <a href="http://tlvince.com/wintersmith-on-heroku">this excellent blog post</a> by <a href="http://tlvince.com/about">Tom Vincent</a> detailing how to do it on heroku,
the right way... static. 

</p>
<p>Sadly I couldn&apos;t quite get his build on heroku itself to work and just check in my build output, but overall I&apos;m happy with the current setup.

</p>
<p>Some quick first observations on heroku itself

</p>
<ul>
<li>feels slower then azure,</li>
<li>the command line is incredible but also confusing, the help mentions <code>run:console [Command]</code> but the actual command is <code>run console [Command]</code></li>
<li>stuff like <code>heroku logs</code> is awesome, </li>
<li>error messages like &apos;Error H14 (No web processes running)` are not idiot (read: me) proof. In hindsight issueing &apos;heroku ps:scale web=1&apos; seems totally obvious.</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on the ease of getting a node app online Azure felt alot easier. I&apos;m not drawing any conclusion from my 30 minute exposure to heroku though.

</p>
<p>Next up on my blog procastination list: fix the VIM markdown highlighter which barfs on quotes.
